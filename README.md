[Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/), [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) and netlify CMS test

This repo contains an example blog that is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org)

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.
