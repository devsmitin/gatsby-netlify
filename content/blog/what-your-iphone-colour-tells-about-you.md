The iPhone 11 (starting at $699) with a single screen size, iPhone 11 Pro (starting at $999), and iPhone 11 Pro Max (starting at $1,099)--both Pro models have two OLED screen sizes--arrived jam-packed with new features. Highlights of the new smartphones include: Longer battery life than previous models, a A13 Bionic processor, improved front and rear cameras and portrait mode, not to mention a new audio system supporting Dolby Atmos, new Smart HDR, spatial audio, night mode, and QuickTake, which allows users to take a video by holding down the shutter button. 



However, it's the fresh palette of colors that really tell a compelling story. The iPhone 11 comes in six finishes: Black, white, yellow, purple, green, and Product red. The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are available in four colors: Midnight green, space gray, silver, and gold (Pros also feature a textured matte finish).
